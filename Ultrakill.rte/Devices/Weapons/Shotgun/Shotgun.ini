	Description = Tap fire for powerful short-ranged attack. Hold fire to set the shotgun to CORE EJECT mode and eject explosive core, the longer you hold the further it flies. Pressing R sets the shotgun to PUMP CHARGE mode and pumps the shotgun. With each pump the attack becomes more powerful but also less accurate. Pumping the shotgun too many times causes it to violently explode hurting the user. Watch out!
